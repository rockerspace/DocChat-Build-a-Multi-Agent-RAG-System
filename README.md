# DocChat-Build-a-Multi-Agent-RAG-System
a multi-agent RAG tool designed to help you ask questions about your documents and receive fact-checked, hallucination-free answers

Have you ever struggled to extract precise information from long, complex documents? Whether it’s a research paper, legal contract, technical report, or environmental study, finding the exact details you need can feel overwhelming.

Build and deploy a multi-agent RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) system that intelligently retrieves, analyzes, and verifies information from complex documents
Integrate hybrid retrieval techniques using BM25 and vector search to improve document understanding and relevance
Implement a verification pipeline that detects hallucinations and ensures factual accuracy in AI-generated responses
Create an intuitive user interface with Gradio, making your document analysis tool accessible to anyone

With DocChat, you can:

Upload and analyze long documents (PDFs, Word files, text reports) with ease
Ask questions about the content and get precise, source-backed answers
Extract specific details from structured documents, even those with tables, figures, and dense text
Avoid AI hallucinations—every response goes through a verification step to ensure factual correctness
Receive an alert when your question is irrelevant to the uploaded documents—so you know when the AI cannot confidently answer based on the provided sources
Retrieve accurate answers even when multiple documents are uploaded—DocChat intelligently finds the right document to reference
